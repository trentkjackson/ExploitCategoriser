[Using the arguments]\n- When using EC the following arguments are required.\n  \n  [The amount of pages to be searched, remember a high number will take longer to load]\n  "?pages:#"\n\n  [The query to be referenced in categories, note: if you would like to use mulitple words you must seperate them with a double ampersand symbol.]\n  "?query:#"\n\n- Once you are brought to the categories found with your query referenced you can view them by typing... \n  \n  [*] being either key words from their title or just the title itself.\n  "?ls:%s" \n\n   e.g. "?ls:denial" will open the Denial of Service category.\n\n\n[Adding your own data and/or categories]\n- Adding data and categories is simple, to add data to the pre-existing categories just add keywords to the category array of your picking, which can be found in the "src/main/java/core/data/Categories.java" file.\n\n- To add your very own category you need the reference data which can be created like so...\n\n    [Must be a string array as it is what the following method requests]\n    String[] Metasploit_Exploits_Category = {\n        "metasploit", "meta"\n    };\n\n- Now to add this data into the categoriser system we must use the following method anywhere before the Categoriser class is instantiated.\n\n    [The text between quotes being the category name]\n    Categories.AddCategory(Metasploit_Exploits_Category, "Metasploit Exploits");\n\n- And you're done! You should see your category appear on the next compile and may view it by following the same procedure as stated above.
