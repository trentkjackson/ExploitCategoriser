A tool to scape, refernece and then categorize all exploits on www.exploit-db.com in releation to your given query. As the the help argument is currently incomplete here is the basic overview...

``?pages:#`` This argument defines the number pages you will be scraping on exploit-db.com, remember a higher number is going to take longer to complete.

``?query:#`` This argument specifies the query that you want referenced and categorized, e.g. Linux. If you would like to use a phrase or sentence remember to connect words with '&&,' e.g. "hello&&world".

``?ls:#`` Once you get shown all your references categorized you can view them by typing this command in, it does not have to be specific, i.e if a category is named "Denial of Service" you can type "denial" or "service" for the same result.

This piece of software is still in production and lacking data. I am going to add easy category creation next but for the meanwhile it is working at a very simple level.
