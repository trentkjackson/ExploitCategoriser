# What is this?
A tool to scape, reference and then categorize all exploits on www.exploit-db.com in releation to your given query. You can easily add categories and data yourself using a simple string array and class method. 

# How do I use this?
Here is the information from the ``?help`` command.

## Using the arguments
- When using EC the following arguments are required.
  
  [The amount of pages to be searched, remember a high number will take longer to load]
  "?pages:#"

  [The query to be referenced in categories, note: if you would like to use mulitple words you must seperate them with a double ampersand symbol.]
  "?query:#"

- Once you are brought to the categories found with your query referenced you can view them by typing... 
  
  [*] being either key words from their title or just the title itself.
  "?ls:%s" 

   e.g. "?ls:denial" will open the Denial of Service category.


## Adding your own data and/or categories
- Adding data and categories is simple, to add data to the pre-existing categories just add keywords to the category array of your picking, which can be found in the "src/main/java/core/data/Categories.java" file.

- To add your very own category you need the reference data which can be created like so...

    [Must be a string array as it is what the following method requests]
    String[] Metasploit_Exploits_Category = {
        "metasploit", "meta"
    };

- Now to add this data into the categoriser system we must use the following method anywhere before the Categoriser class is instantiated.

    [The text between quotes being the category name]
    Categories.AddCategory(Metasploit_Exploits_Category, "Metasploit Exploits");

- And you're done! You should see your category appear on the next compile and may view it by following the same procedure as stated above.
